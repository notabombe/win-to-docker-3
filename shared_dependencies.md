1. Docker Image Name: This is the name of the Docker image that will be used across all files. In this case, it would be a Windows 11 image.

2. Container Name: This is the name of the Docker container that will be created and used across all files.

3. Docker Compose Service Name: This is the name of the service defined in the docker-compose.yml file, which will be used to manage the container.

4. Docker Network: If the container needs to be part of a specific Docker network, this network name will be shared across the files.

5. Volume Mounts: If any volumes are being mounted to the container, these mount points will be shared across the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml.

6. Environment Variables: Any environment variables that are being passed into the container will be shared across the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml.

7. Start Script: The name of the start script (start_container.sh) will be referenced in the Dockerfile and potentially in the docker-compose.yml file.

8. Ports: If any ports are being exposed from the container, these will be shared across the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml.

Please note that as we are creating a Docker container with Windows 11, the Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, and start_container.sh will not interact with any DOM elements, message names, or JavaScript functions. These are typically used in web development and are not relevant in this context.
